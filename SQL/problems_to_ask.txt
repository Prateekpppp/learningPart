--- How to submit the assignment





Problems in assignment-2:-
--------------------------

drop function dbo.stuffChicken;

create function stuffChicken()
returns varchar(250)

AS
BEGIN

declare @txt varchar
set @txt = STUFF('Quick Bites', 1, 5, 'Quick Chicken');
return @txt

END

select dbo.stuffChicken()
 giving output as --- (Q) only



-- groupby for multiple columns

-- What is the minimum sales for each product ?
select ProductId , avg(Inventory) from fact group by ProductId;




QUERY ISSUES :-
------------

SELECT AreaCode,sum(Sales) as Total_Sales,sum(Profit) as Total_Profit FROM `fact` group by AreaCode order by AreaCode;
this gives 156 rows

SELECT * FROM `location` order by AreaCode;
this gives 157 rows




select * from employee where FIRST_NAME like 'L%' and LAST_NAME like '%E'
union
select * from employee where FIRST_NAME like 'L%E';



sub query after from operator :-
----------------------

select EMPLOYEE_ID,max(SALARY) from (
    select * from employee 
    where DEPARTMENT_ID=30
);
